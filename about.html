<u><b>About</b></u>
Language Busters is a language learning 'roguelike'. The goal in any roguelike is to keep moving deeper into the dungeon, find items and conquer terrible creatures in a turn based manner with very basic graphics. The hope is that this incredibly addictive format will help language learners improve their vocabulary easily.

Sites like Duolingo and Memrise try to 'gamify' language learning, but they don't quite reach that 'just one more level' feeling that keeps you playing (and hopefully learning) well into the early hours.
